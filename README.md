# neural_network_cpp
The basics of a feed forward neural network written in C++ and used to predict a handle of binary logic gates.

Overall this was a largely pedagogical example. Writing the math out for each relationship explictily helped me better understand how aspects of the neural networks are connected. While it was help, no steps were taken to ensure efficient computation.
